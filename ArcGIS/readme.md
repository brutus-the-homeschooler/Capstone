# ArcGIS Outputs for ACS 2022 Data

## Overview
This folder contains the geographic data generated from the **2022 American Community Survey (ACS)** supplementary dataset. These outputs are processed using Python scripts, specifically leveraging the **geopandas** and **pygris** libraries, to map FIPS codes for places and states across the United States.

## Files in this Directory
- **2022_ACS_All_Places.csv**: A CSV file containing data about all places included in the ACS dataset, excluding geometry.
- **2022_ACS_All_Places.geojson**: A GeoJSON file containing geographic data (including geometry) for all places in the ACS dataset. This file can be used with various GIS tools for further analysis and visualization.
- **2022_ACS_All_Places_Shapefile**: A Shapefile format containing geographic boundaries for all places in the ACS dataset. This folder includes multiple files (`.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`, etc.) and can be imported into most GIS software.

## How These Files Are Generated
These files are generated by a Python script, [`arcgis_all_places.py`](../Scripts/EDA/arcgis_all_places.py), which:
1. Downloads the ACS 2022 SQLite database from this repository.
2. Fetches the place shapefiles using the FIPS codes for places and states.
3. Creates geographic files (CSV, GeoJSON, and Shapefiles) representing the places within the dataset.
4. Outputs the results into this directory for further use or analysis.

### Workflow
The generation of these files is automated using a GitHub Actions workflow. Every time the workflow runs, it:
1. Pulls the latest data from the SQLite database in the `Database` folder.
2. Runs the `arcgis_all_places.py` script.
3. Pushes the generated output files to this directory.

## How to Use the Files
- **CSV File**: You can use this file for non-geographic data analysis. It contains all place data except geometry, making it useful for simple statistical analysis or integrating with other datasets.
- **GeoJSON File**: This file includes the geometry of each place. You can load it into geographic data visualization tools such as **ArcGIS**, **QGIS**, or **Google Earth** to explore place boundaries.
- **Shapefile**: The Shapefile format is commonly used in GIS software (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS). It contains both geometry and attributes about places. Import this file into your GIS software to view or analyze geographic data.

## Notes
- Ensure you have the appropriate software (ArcGIS, QGIS, etc.) to work with GeoJSON and Shapefiles.
- The outputs are automatically updated with each run of the GitHub workflow.
